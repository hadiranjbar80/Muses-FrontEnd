Muses is a web application to query song lyrics and get them as fast and easy as possible in one place. There is also possible to listen to the song that you queried for in-place.

# Muses (Design Language)
Muses uses a simple and accessible design language that enables users to interact easily with this software. The design process mainly focused around accessibility and familiarity with the design language, so it is expected that users have an easy-to-understand learning process when working with Muses.

Fonts are everithing in Muses, since all the music lyrics and interface is based-on fonts and texts, the responsibility of choosing one is really difficult. We use **Comfortaa** font family designed by *Johan Aakerlund*.

> "Comfortaa is a rounded geometric sans-serif type design intended for large sizes. It is absolutely free, both for personal and commercial use."
Says, Johan Aakerlund; we thank him for his goodwill and skill.
