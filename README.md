Fonts are everithing in Muses, since all the music lyrics and interface is based-on fonts and texts, the responsibility of choosing one is really difficult. We use **Comfortaa** font family designed by *Johan Aakerlund*.

> "Comfortaa is a rounded geometric sans-serif type design intended for large sizes. It is absolutely free, both for personal and commercial use."
Says, Johan Aakerlund; we thank him for his goodwill and skill.
